<body lang="en-GB" dir="ltr"><h1 class="western">SigmoID Installation</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please donâ€™t launch SigmoID until all the
requirements listed below are satisfied! 
</p>
<p><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mac OS, we strongly recommend moving
SigmoID.app to the Applications folder before the first launch. We
also recommend to launch SigmoID for the first time only after all
required software is installed.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SigmoID v.2
works on OS X (10.10 and up) and 64-bit Linux distributions (Ubuntu
16 and Mint 16 and up were tested). Other Linux distributions may
work provided Xojo requirements are met.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full
list of platform-specific system requirements is located at <a href="https://docs.xojo.com/Resources:System_Requirements">Xojo
web site</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SigmoID relies heavily on
Python and will have severely limited functionality without it. The
various python scripts included with SigmoID require python 3 with a
matching version of Biopython.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requirements listed below should be installed in the following
order:</p>
<p>1) <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a> or <a href="https://www.mpich.org/">MPICH</a>
to allow MEME and MeShClust to use multiple threads. Absence of
OpenMPI will be especially noticeable in the <i>de novo</i> TFBS
inference pipeline: meme will run in a single thread slowing the
pipeline down significantly. MeShClust will not run at all, so one of
the clustering steps will be skipped which will decrease the quality
of the motifs inferred.<br>
2) Install <a href="https://meme-suite.org/meme/">MEME
Suite</a>. Depending on your system set-up, MEME may require
additional libraries and perl modules (html output generation may not
work without those).<br>
3) Install <a href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsToolsmith/MeShClust">MeShClust</a>.<br>
4) Install <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/">NCBI
Entrez Direct (EDirect)</a>.<br>
5) <a href="http://hmmer.org/">HMMER</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paths to all external programs can be
changed in the preferences. SigmoID will try to find the paths to the
versions installed on your system (via the PATH variable). Any
missing programs will be reported in the main window at launch.</p>
<p><u>Optional software</u><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://autosome.ru/ChIPMunk/">ChIPMunk</a> is not required
for standard operation of SigmoID, but may be very helpful for inference
of nonpalindromic motifs. To use ChIPmunk, please set the path to the
chipmunk.jar file in the preferences.<br>
</p>Promoter inference requires Clustal Omega and BioProspector. The
paths to the executables of these programs should also be set in the
preferences.
